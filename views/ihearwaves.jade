        h2 I hear waves - (Spring, 2017)
        p.lead I hear waves is an experimental documentary about the fragility of time, using my familyâ€™s annual beach trips as a measure. It was created as my first semester project for my Documentary Film Production course, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
